# Surf Shop Temperature Analysis

## Overview
After the initial analysis of the weather data, W. Avy would like some additional analysis done
specifically on the months of June and December. This will give a better idea of the weather year round
to determine if the shop will be viable all months of the year.

## Results
There are a few key differences in the temperatures between June and December.

- The average temperature in June is about 4 degrees higher than it is in December.
- The minimum temperature in December was 56, while in June it was pretty noticeably higher at 64.
- The temperature spread, or standard deviation, is very close in both months.

## Summary
In summary, though the temperatures are slightly lower in December than they are in June, they are close enough that the viability of the surf shop shouldn't be affected. One thing that could give some additional insight into this data would be to query the precipitation for those same months and see how it compares. This would give a clearer idea of how noticeable the temperature differences would be for each month. Another piece of information that could be useful would be to query the data by year and look at any differences from year to year. There is a chance that overall climate patterns could affect both the temperature and precipitation for any specific year, and it would be nice to see if there are any patterns or anomalous data.
